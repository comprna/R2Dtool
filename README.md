# R2Dtool

Genomics utilities for handling, integrating, and viualising isoform-mapped RNA feature data.    


  - **Integrate** transcriptome-mapped data: R2Dtool performs liftover of transcriptome-mapped RNA features to their corresponding genomic coordinates

  - **Annotate** transcriptome-mapped sites: R2Dtool annotates transcript-specific metatranscript coordinates and absolute and relative distances to annotated transcript landmarks, in an isoform-specific manner.

  - **Visualise** isoform-aware RNA feature distributions: R2Dtool introduces isoform-aware **metatranscript** plots and **metajunction** plots to study the positonal distribution of RNA features around annotated RNA landmarks.

# Usage

## Handling isoform-mapped RNA sites 

**Liftover** transcriptome-mapped features to genomic coordinates:

```
Usage: r2d liftover -i <input> -g <gtf>

Arguments:
    -i, --input <input>: Path to tab-separated transcriptome sites in BED format. 
    -g, --gtf <annotation>: Path to gene structure annotation in GTF format.

Options:
    -H, --header: Indicates the input file has a header, which will be preserved in the output [Default: False]
    -o, --output <OUTPUT>: Path to output file [Default: STDOUT]

```
- Liftover prepends 6 columns to the input file, containing the genome coordinates of the transcript features in BED format
- All data in the original input are preserved in the output and shifted by 6 columns 

**Annotate** transcriptome-mapped sites with isoform-specific distances to transcript landmarks:

```
Usage: r2d annotate -i <input> -g <gtf>

Arguments:
    -i, --input <input>: Path to tab-separated transcriptome sites in BED format. 
    -g, --gtf <annotation>: Path to gene structure annotation in GTF format.

Options:
    -H, --header: Indicates the input file has a header, which will be preserved in the output [Default: False]
    -o, --output <OUTPUT>: Path to output file [Default: STDOUT]

```

Annotation adds the following information to the epitranscriptomic sites as additional coluumns, relying on the gene structure GTF to generate these data.

```
transcript_biotype | gene_name | gene_id | tx_len | cds_len | utr5_len | utr3_len | cds_start | cds_end | tx_end  | rel_pos | abs_cds_start | abs_cds_end | up_junc_dist | down_junc_dist
```

- ```tx_len```, ```cds-len```, ```utr5-len``` and ```utr3-len```represents the lengths of the entire transcript, the coding sequence, and the 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs)
- ```cds_start``` and ```cds_end``` represent the positions of the coding sequence start and end compared to the transcript.
- ```rel_pos``` represents the scaled metatrascript position of the given RNA feature, between 0 and 3, where 0 represents transcript start-site, 1 represents CDS start, 2 represent CDS end, and 3 represents the 3' transcript end. 
- ```abs_cds_start``` and ```abs_cds_end``` represent the absolute distance (in nt) of a given feature from the cds start and end
- ```up_junc_dist``` and ```down_junc_dist``` repreesnt the absolute distance (in nt) of a given site from the nearest upstream and downstream splice-junction contained in a given transcript

> [!NOTE]
> - ```liftover``` and ```annotate``` requires columns 1-6 to contain feature coordinates against a transcriptome reference
> - ```annotate``` can be perfomed before, but __not__ after, ```liftover```
> - ```annotate``` requires protein-coding gene models in order to calculate feature metacoordinates and distances to CDS starts and ends 
> - The GTF file used must exactly match the transcriptome to which features are mapped 

## Visualising isoform-aware RNA feature metadistributions

**Plot** the **metatranscript** distribution of RNA features:

```
Rscript R2_plotMetaTranscript.R <sites> <output>  <filter field> <cutoff> <lower/upper>

positional arguments:
- path to annotated file generated by R2Dtool annotate 
- path to output plot (including extension, e.g. .svg or .png)
- filter field; column used to select significant sites
- cutoff; integer value to use for determining significant
- "lower"/"upper": Select sites that have a significanace _lower_ or _higher_ than the cutoff value in the significance field 

```

**Plot** the **metajunction** distribution of RNA features:

```
Rscript R2_plotMetaJunction.R <sites> <output>  <filter field> <cutoff> <lower/upper>

positional arguments:
- path to annotated file generated by R2Dtool annotate 
- path to output plot (including extension, e.g. .svg or .png)
- filter field; column used to select significant sites
- cutoff; integer value to use for determining significant
- "lower"/"upper": Select sites that have a significnace _lower_ or _higher_ than the cutoff value in the significance field 

```
# Installation and dependencies 

#### Dependencies 

> [!NOTE]
> R2Dtool's core ```liftover``` and ```annotation``` functionality are built into an executable program built on Rust, and dependencies are managed during compilation by Cargo. 
> R2Dtool's ```metatranscript``` and ```metajunction``` plotting functinality are implemented as executable R scripts, and depend on the following packages:

```
r==4.2.0
tidyverse==1.3.1
genomicFeatures==1.48.0
rtracklayer==1.56.0
```
#### Compiling R2Dtool from source: 

```
# requires rust 
git clone git@github.com:comprna/R2Dtool.git && cd R2Dtool
cargo build --release

# add R2DTOOL to PATH
export PATH="$PATH:$(pwd)/target/release"
```

#### Testing R2Dtool installation 

```
cd R2Dtool && export PATH="$PATH:$(pwd)/target/release/"
mkdir ./test/outputs/ 2>/dev/null

# liftover transcriptomic sites to genomic coordinates
r2d liftover -H -g ./test/GRCm39_subset.gtf -i ./test/out_CHEUI_modelII.bed > ./test/outputs/liftover.bed

# annotate bed-like transcriptomic sites with metatranscript coordinates, distance to splice junctions, transcript structure and transcript biotype

r2d annotate -H -g ./test/GRCm39_subset.gtf -i ./test/out_CHEUI_modelII.bed > ./test/outputs/annotate.bed

# liftover sites after annotating them
r2d liftover -H -g ./test/GRCm39_subset.gtf -i ./test/outputs/annotate.bed > ./test/outputs/liftover_annotate.bed

```

> Test data was generated using [cheui](https://github.com/comprna/CHEUI) and converted to bed-like coordinates using [R2Dtool utilities](https://github.com/comprna/R2Dtool/blob/main/scripts/cheui_to_bed.sh).



# Input and output data structure

R2Dtool is designed to work with tab-delimited, plain text BED-like files (optionally) with a column names in row 1. Following UCSC's recommendations, input and output BED files should be tab-delimited plain-text:

- column 1 should represent transcript,
- column 2 and 3 should represent the coordinate of interest in zero-based, half open coordinates (e.g. the third nucleotide of a transcript is represented as (2,3),
- column 5, representing strand, is assumed as being (+)
- columns 4, and any column greater than 5 are preserved during annotation or liftover, and may be used to hold additional information, e.g. predictions of RNA modification stoichiometry, probability, etc.

The GTF annotation provided must contain identical gene structures used to generate the transcriptome, including identical transcript names in the FASTA header. One option is to use genomes, transcriptomes and gene structures from the same genome release. Another option is for users to generate their own transcriptome using a genome and gene structure file, e.g. using gffread.  

# Utilities

### Convert CHEUI model II output to a BED-like input

- This script transposes CHEUI coordinates by +3 (BED interval start) and +4 (BED interval end) to represent a single nucleotides, and rearranges columns to become bed-like.

```
bash cheui_to_bed.sh [cheui model II output file] [cheui_to_bed output file]
```

# General notes
- Transcriptome to genome liftover relies only on transcript_id, site coordinates, and strand (columns 1:3,6)
- The annotation used must correspond exactly to the transcriptome used
